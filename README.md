## 💡 About Me

I started in QA, where I learned to test with precision and think like a user. Now, I'm making the leap into product—bringing my engineering background, collaboration mindset, and a deep commitment to inclusion along for the ride.

When I'm not debugging or wireframing, I’m probably:
- chasing my daughter around  
- solving a puzzle  
- planning my next food adventure 🍜✈️
